----- Hi! -----

- Folder structure. At the beginning of development, a folder structure was created to better visualize future work.

- Created a job vacancy card and a page for them. Created a job vacancy card component and a button component for future use, as well as a page to display cards with an input component for future job search functionality.
  
- API service created. A service for fetching data from the API was created to populate the cards with corresponding information. AXIOS and useSWR were used.
  
- Pagination. Pagination capability added to the job vacancy cards page. Built-in API pagination was used.
  
- Creation of slug and liked hook. Created a slug for detailed viewing of job vacancy information from the card and a hook that allows saving vacancies in LOCALSTORAGE for future use.
  
- Created a page for saved vacancies. Created a card component for saved vacancies.
  
- Created a profile creation page with data storage. The profile is stored in LOCALSTORAGE. Formik was used to create the form and validation with Yup.
